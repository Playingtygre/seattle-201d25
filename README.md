# 201 Instructor Guide Repo  
> This repository is designed to help instructors get up and running with teaching a 201.  Below are details regarding each directory and it's corresponding purpose, as well as setup.  

## [Configs](configs/)  
> This directory contains the following files needed for 201:  

* `.eslintrc` - 201 linter  
* `.gitignore` - gitignore to provide to students as needed  

## [Lectures](lectures/)  
> the `lectures` directory is intended for instructors to use for any other class resources that are currently available. This includes slides, daily lecture overview, and prior code examples from other instructors.  

As you are running your 201 class, please make a new branch with any additional code demos you may do in class. In the above `lectures` directory, there is a corresponding `code-demos` directory for this purpose inside of each of the class directories.  

## [Public](public/)  
> This directory is meant to serve as the student facing repository for your class. To create a new class repository complete the following:  

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.  
2. On the [Code Fellows GitHub](https://github.com/codefellows) create a new repository with the following naming convention: `<location>-<course-code>`. For example: `seattle-201n8`  

3. Copy the `public` directory of this repository to the new repository you created. 

If all goes well, you should now be ready to go with your student-facing repository.  

## [Solutions](solutions/)  
> This is still under development and is **NOT** a complete list of solutions for the course.  

This is where instructors may add solutions for specific labs or other assignments.
