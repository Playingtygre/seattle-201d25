We're going to write code, line-by-line, to create a constructor function called "Dog" and then instantiate two Dog objects for dogs named Parker and Demi.

The Dog constructor function has two parameters: name and breed. In addition, all dogs will be assigned a property called "legs" that has a numeric value of 4.

The Dog constructor will also have a method called "says" that takes a parameter named "bark" and then console.log()s the argument that is passed in.

We will create an instance of Parker, who is an English Shepherd, and have him say 'woof'. We will also create an instance of Demi, who is a Border Collie, and changed the value of her 'legs' property to the numeric value of 3.

Note that for this automatically graded quiz your input must exactly match the desired output. Keep in mind the following:
- Conventions for capitalization and case
- Single-quotes, always
- Be precise with punctuation
- Put a space after any commas
- Use no indenting in your responses
- Where a line of code ends in a curly brace, be sure to include it at the end
- We will not include any lines that only contain closing curly braces
- All names for variables, functions, properties, parameters, and methods must precisely match what is given in the prompts.
